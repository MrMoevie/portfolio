this game was made together with a friend for the GMTK Game Jam 2019!

I personally haven't done that much off the coding as my friend figured out how to make the game move around on the screen.
As I did not know how it worked exactly and we wanted to hurry to get it done I made temporary assets and the menu's and things like that.
